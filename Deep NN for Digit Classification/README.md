# ROB313 Assignment 4 - Neural Networks

The program found in 'nn_main.py' and 'a4_mod.py' contains the code that is used to acquire the results of 
question 1-6. The specific functions for each question is sectioned off in the script, and need not be touched. 

To run the file, the only modifications that need to be made are to the main block. Each question has it's own section
in the 'if __name__ == "__main__":' block, and it is clearly outlined with comments. To the run the code for a desired
question, simply change the corresponding boolean to True at the top of the main block, and run. Required numeric 
results will be printed and required images will be save to the current directory.
